    notice1: "Before issuing coins: You need to prepare two wallets. The first wallet, as the issuer, must be a brand new account. The second wallet acts as a hot wallet. To prevent random issuance, both wallets must hold at least 10,000 XAG. The issued assets cannot be reserved currencies such as: XAG, XRP, USDT, ETH, BTC, Ripple, XLM, TRX, etc.",
    notice2: "After issuing coins: Other users need to add assets (using the asset code and the issuer's account address), and they can receive hot wallet transfers after they are added.",
    notice3: "Trade the new coin with XAG to create buy and sell orders. Xrpgen will automatically bridge with other currencies such as USDT, ETH, etc., so as to realize pairwise transactions with any currency. (Note: Do not use the issuer's wallet or the hot wallet for trade. It is recommended that hot wallets be used for distribution purposes only.)"
